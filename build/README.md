# Build Scripts

This directory contains the scripts that travis and appveyor uses to build the project.

Tests on the entire [`narrowspark/skeleton-generators`](https://github.com/narrowspark/skeleton-generators) repository,
and then sends code coverage reports out to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/github/narrowspark/skeleton-generators).
